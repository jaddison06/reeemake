# #define this in all source files
define VERSION 69


# Some additional markup is required in source files
#
# These all have the syntax //REEEMAKE <command> <options>
# and must be located on their own line, with no whitespace before (or after?)
#
# for a Reeemake #define, put the comment
# //REEMAKE defines
# wherever you want the #defines to be located.
# (this is really annoying and will be done automatically soon, i promise)
#
# To add a source file to a group, use
# //REEEMAKE group <group-name>
# Source files can be in multiple groups
